Amusement Park Simulation - Operations Analytics
Created a comprehensive amusement park model using Simio. 
Simio model was used to compute all the desired wait times for different rides, designating fast-pass and regular-pass customer and activities for customers, the number of visitors in the park, the overall customer satisfaction and other information as required in the model description.
Multiple add on processes including data tables, time scheduling grid, assigning statistics, balking, building sequence tables and binding input data and experiments were created and ran throughout the model.
